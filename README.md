## 2021

I have chosen to not host my source code on Github at the time being, until such as time as:

- There are updated versions of solid free software licenses available that forbids use of the licensed source code for statistical models used for anything but editing the source code itself
- And Github recognises those licenses

Information in the public domain could be freely available as training data to neural networks.
However, just because something is publically available does not mean that it is in the _public_ _domain_.
Open Source software is an example of public information which is not in the public domain: open source software is still under copyright, for use under a license.

This issue is just not about ownership.
For one thing, I do absolutely intend to publish _ugly_ source code that I have written to get good performance in/on specific cases/platforms/compilers, that which I absolutely not hold as being good examples for others to learn from.

## 2026
Apparently, Github doesn't have any intention to mend their ways.
Instead its owner has chosen the path of maximum explotation and insult: adopted the name of their explotative tool everywhere in its product lines, even so far as being on the keyboards of affiliated computer manufacturers.

Open source advocates often talk about the [Four Freedoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software#Definition).

We need to add a _fifth_ freedom: _Freedom_ _from_ _exploitation_.

I am going to forthwith work on software for a _closed_ _web_, for people who have moral fibre, who believe in personal freedom, solidarity and community.
Software will be available in a web-of-trust, in which only software from verified authors (_human_ authors) will be allowed, and from which it source code is not allowed to leak.

I had rather not wanted to do this. I want to create interesting, useful stuff for everyone to use and contribute.
But I'd have to do this to protect it, to protect myself and our future.
If you feel like me, have a project that is aligned with this way of thinking, or know of some other project that does, then please reach out.
