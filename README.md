I have chosen to not host my source code on Github at the time being, until such as time as:

- There are updated versions of solid free software licenses available that forbids use of the licensed source code for statistical models used for anything but editing the source code itself
- And Github recognises those licenses

... Just to be sure

Information in the public domain could be freely available as training data to neural networks.
However, just because something is publically available does not mean that it is in the _public_ _domain_.
Open Source software is an example of public information which is not in the public domain: open source software is still under copyright, for use under a license.

This issue is just not about ownership.
For one thing, I do absolutely intend to publish _ugly_ source code that I have written to get good performance in/on specific cases/platforms/compilers, that which I absolutely not hold as being good examples for others to learn from.
